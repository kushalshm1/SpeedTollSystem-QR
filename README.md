# SpeedTollSystem using QR Code

## Problem Description:
We all know highways are meant to be fast, but in India, toll booths are the most crowded and slowest places which distracts us from main moive of highway that is speed.

We also have a technology named FastTag, but due to its cost of usage and maintainence, it is also not feasible as most of the times FastTag lanes are closed and sometmes scanner doesn't work.


## Solution:

In a nutshell, our objectives are
1. To increase toll booth processing speed
2. Reduce Cost(As FastTag installation in costly in cars)
3. Increase profits by reducing man-power

Description of the solution:

We have made a system which automatically scans the QRCode and deducts the payment using UPI feature of the Reserve Bank Of India.

There are three phases of our machine:
1. New User Registration
2. Make Transaction
3. Add Money to Wallet
4. Exit
